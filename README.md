# Board Game

A basic board game between two teams- the Crossfitters and the Powerlifters.
Each team can use soldier, medic and sniper characters.
Characters from two opposing teams should fight each other using offensive actions until one team remains with the only characters on the grid board.
Actions and attributes for each character is detailed in its header file.
This is based on an assignment given at Systems Programming course.
