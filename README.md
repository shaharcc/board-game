# Board Game

A basic board game between two teams- the Crossfitters and the Powerlifters. <br />
Each team can use soldier, medic and sniper characters. <br />
Characters from two opposing teams should fight each other using offensive actions until one team remains with the only characters on the grid board. <br />
Actions and attributes for each character is detailed in its header file. <br />
 <br />
This is based on an assignment given at Systems Programming course. <br />
